# TennisKatasDotnet
First project created in TDD to determine the score of each player with a list of sets in a tennis match.

## Parameters
To know who wins, the code analyzes each set and if it a male between two mens or two womens. 

## Observations
Not a perfect project. There is a lot of things to improve but for now I like this first experience in TDD.
